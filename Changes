Revision history for Perl extension Urlader

1.01 Sun Jun 17 15:09:57 CEST 2012
	- use :raw:perlio to open files for retarted operating systems, although
          :perlio *should* work - maybe a perl 5.8 issue? (reported by sten).
        - Urlader::lock now official part of the API, and doesn't cause
          "free unreferenced scalar" error.

1.0  Mon Feb  6 23:08:58 CET 2012
        - warn about set*id or privileged operation.
        - properly do PATH search on unix to find executable (*blush*).
	- more tips and tricks.
        - use FILE_SHARE_DELETE when opening override/executable and lockfiles
          on windows.

0.2   Sun Jan  8 10:12:00 CET 2012

          release.

0.01  Sat Dec 31 11:15:29 CET 2011
